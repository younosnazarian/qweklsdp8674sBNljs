<p>Hi, I’m Younos Nazarian. I’m a Network Expert, Trainer, photographer, and entrepreneur.</p>
<p>This website is the home of my professional life. I write about networking technologies/concepts and how to implement them in the real world. I’m trying to demystify networking concepts and show you how to implement them on a network appliance.</p>
<p>To achieve that goal, I write articles and create videos to show you exactly how things work in action according to what I learned throughout all of my active years. My specific focus though is on Juniper Networks Junos operating system and SRX security gateways.</p>
<p>Regarding Juniper Networks, JNCIE-SEC (#314) is my latest achievement. I have ten years plus experience working with Juniper Networks products and 3000+ hours of instructing and training experience. I am privileged to work with the most prominent carriers/enterprises and train hundreds of people.</p>
<p>Please feel free to <a href="https://www.krytpomesh.com/contact/">contact</a> me for any training and consulting services.<br>
I don’t claim to have all the answers, and I still have a lot to learn, but I’m happy to share what I’ve learned along the way.</p>
<p>Soon I will provide you with a subscription email serivce, then you will be able to register and get a new email once I post any new articles.</p>
