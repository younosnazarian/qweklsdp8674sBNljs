<h2><a id="Introduction_2"></a>Introduction</h2>
<h3><a id="What_this_is_all_about_4"></a>What is this all about?</h3>
<p>FromScratch is about imagining a real-world scenario with its demands, and how to address those demands FromScratch. I’ve been thinking about creating such contents for quite a while; however, I have never had the chance to do so, mainly for two reasons: I’ve been busy and lazy!</p>
<p>You can always find gazillions of How-tos on the Internet. How-tos are a quick way to see how to get something done, but many of them only address the partial and merely relative pieces of configuration. They do not reveal the entire configuration and how to adapt it under different circumstances.<br>
In this series of articles, I will show you how to get things done FromScratch. It means: I literally will <strong>delete</strong> everything off the appliance before I start setting it up. Thus, there will be no confusion, no missing parts, no assumption of some pre-configured commands; unless, I have already explained it in another article, or an initial pre-config file. I will not only type every command and tell the reason behind it, but also create a video implementing it. I suggest that you first read the article and then start watching its video.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: Some articles might be very long so that they will be divided into several episodes; each episode releases separately and sequentially. In this case, each episode is depended on the episode before it.</em></p>
<h3><a id="In_this_episode_16"></a>In this episode</h3>
<p>I want to show you how to start working with Juniper SRX firewalls from the very beginning.</p>
<p>The very beginning is when you open the box, take out your device, put it on your table (or mount it in a rack), and plug it into an outlet. Right after that, the LEDs on your device start blinking and changing colors and the fans start to rotate – depending on how big your appliance is, fans could sound like a hum or a roar! Finally, if everything goes well, your device will reach to the point that it is ready to be configured.</p>
<p>SRX needs you to bring it to life and put it in your network; however, before you do so, you have to put some initial configuration in place; you also need to make sure that your appliance itself is hardened enough against potential threats.</p>
<h3><a id="Prerequisites_23"></a>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>I try to keep my articles and videos as simple as possible; still, I am assuming that you have basic knowledge of networking, TCP/IP, Junos OS (equivalent to JNCIA-JUNOS), routing, switching, ACL and hands-on working experience for a few years in the field of networking.<br>
If you have never heard of the terminology mentioned above, the contents of this article may not work in your favor. Last but not least, you should be comfortable working with different platforms and not to be scared of command-line environments.</p>

</ul>

<h3><a id="This_article_discusses_28"></a>Scenario and Topologies</h3>

<p><strong>Kryptomesh</strong>, this is the name of a hypothetical company – so far – that is just going to start operating in the next two weeks. Marina, who is the company’s owner – and well, very ambitious Spanish girl – rented a cozy office in Palo Alto, CA.<br>
She is aiming that one day her company becomes a legendary establishment and is planning to buy many pieces of networking equipment for her office such as PCs, switches, servers, and a firewall. I suggested her to get an SRX firewall for her office. And since I happened to be his fiancee, I am the one who is going to configure it – probably for free! We haven’t gotten anything but a physical server, a small switch and an SRX firewall. I am planning to install ESXi on the physical server and create a few virtual machines that are going to play roles such as monitoring server, NTP server, AAA server, DNS server, etc. All these virtual machines, for now, are located in the management cloud. We haven’t yet ordered PCs, Internet link, and any other components. Remember, this is merely about SRX itself configuration. We shall discuss the server configuration in other articles. Below, you will find the topology:</p>
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/2018-12-13/Topology.png" alt="Network Topology">

<h3><a id="The_topology_above_has_the_following_components_37"></a>The topology above, has the following components:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>SRX:</strong> It is either vSRX version 12 or 18 on EVE or ESXi platforms.</li>
<li><strong>NTP Server:</strong> A basic NTP server on a Debian Linux.</li>
<li><strong>DNS Server:</strong> A basic DNS server on a Debian Linux.</li>
<li><strong>AAA Server:</strong> FreeRADIUS on a Debian Linux</li>
<li><strong>Syslog Server:</strong> A basic Syslog Server on a Debian Linux.</li>
<li><strong>NSM Server:</strong> PRTG</li>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> A MacBook laptop</li>
<li><strong>Management Cloud:</strong> It is an Out-of-Band Management (OBM) network containing all servers that provide services for all networking devices. It may include NTP server, monitoring server, AAA server, SNMP server, and other NOC-related services. Although our network is tiny and having a management cloud seems redundant, but we think big.
Let’s Begin</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="Lets_Begin_48"></a>Let’s Begin</h3>
<p>Your CLI looks like below once you connect your console cable to your appliance and press enter on your “terminal emulator” blank page for the first time:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f4f6f8;"><code>login:

</code></pre>
<p>A login prompt is waiting for your input. All you have to type is the word <strong>“root”</strong> following by an Enter. Your prompt is ending with <strong>#</strong> now (in previous and some Junos versions it would be a <strong>%</strong> sign), which is a Unix/Linux-based shell. You may use this environment only on rare occasions during your appliance lifetime, and as far as I'm concerned, it is only root user that goes directly to this environment after login. Then you type <strong>cli</strong> to enter to <strong>“operational mode”</strong>. If you see <strong>&gt;</strong> at the end of your prompt, it means that you are in operational mode. All other users except root enter directly to this mode, which makes it unnecessary to type <strong>cli</strong> for other non-root use.</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f4f6f8;"><code>loging: root

<pre style="background-color: #f4f6f8;"><code>root&gt; configure

</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we delete everything off the device, ignoring factory default configuration. This is a FromScratch guide after all! You may verify it by issuing <strong>show</strong> command.</p>

<p>Perfect! Now let’s configure our SRX. Before continue reading, please scroll up and glance over the topology again.</p>
<h3><a id="Configuring_Basics_104"></a>Configuring Basics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Root password:</strong> You cannot commit an empty configuration nor a configuration without a root password. Configuring the root password is mandatory. It should have a minimum length of 6, and it requires a change of case, digits or punctuation. You need to enter the password twice. My password is: <strong>Abc123@</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color: #f4f6f8;"><code>root# set system root-authentication plain-text-password

</code></pre>
<p><em>NOTE: When you enter a clear text password, the Junos OS calculates the MD5 hash of the password and save the hashed version it. The word “encrypted” is not accurate.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hostname:</strong> You need to pick a name for your device. This name could represent its function or model or location or some random name. The name of the device is usually a mixture of personal preferences and the company’s naming policy (if we have such a policy). I picked the name <strong>“SRX”</strong> for my device. Your prompt reflects your hostname after commit.</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color: #f4f6f8;"><code>[edit]
root# set system host-name SRX

root# commit

[edit]
root@SRX#

</code></pre>
<p><em>NOTE: Right after committing, the command prompt is reflecting the hostname separated from the username by an <strong>@</strong> sign.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Management IP:</strong> This is the IP you use for managing/monitoring your device. On most new physical SRX appliances even more recent versions of virtual appliances, you will find a dedicated ethernet port for management purposes. This dedicated port named <strong>“fxp0”</strong> and terminated in control plane itself.</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color: #f4f6f8;"><code>[edit]
root@SRX# set interfaces fxp0.0 family inet address 192.168.100.200/24

</code></pre>
<p><em>NOTE: In case of lacking such port, you may use any standard network ports for management purposes – unlike fxp0 these ports are terminated in the data plane, and the traffic has to go through a link called “internal link” to enter the control plane. However, membership to the “management” functional zone along with setting up host-inbound-traffic is mandatory for when you utilize regular networking ports for management purposes.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Management Protocols:</strong> Protocols that without them you will leave with no way to connect to your appliance and manage it. The mentioned protocols include <strong>SSH</strong>, <strong>HTTPS</strong>, <strong>HTTP</strong>, <strong>telnet</strong>, etc. Even though I would only use <strong>SSH</strong> to manage an SRX appliance, I have also included the configuration required for <strong>HTTPS</strong> for those who prefer <strong>GUI</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>DNS:</strong> You SRX is also a host like any other hosts similar to PCs and Servers. It needs some DNS information mainly to translate names into IP addresses. Someone might ask: Why on earth a network device demands translate names into IPs? Well, one example of that is when your SRX appliance is equipped with IPS and wants to retrieve attacks/application database from the Juniper website. It does it by accessing a particular URL.<br>
A URL contains a series of letters that need to be translated into an IP. You may set several DNS servers for redundancy. Although, I have only configured two DNS servers below.</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
<p>The name <strong>yahoo.com</strong> successfully resolved into its IP address <strong>“72.30.35.10”</strong>, however; it is not reachable. It’s because we haven’t yet defined a default route to provide Internet connectivity, but evidently, the DNS is working perfectly. I added “inet” after the ping command to make sure that the name will be resolved into IPv4.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: Since in this scenario an internal DNS server is available and it’s reachable within the same subnet, we do not need to have a route.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date &amp; Time:</strong> The commands are self-explanatory, but you have to keep it in mind to set the time zone and commit your configuration before setting up the time itself. The time could be set manually or be retrieved from an NTP server. Both of which has been shown. <em>NOTE: You use the command “run” when you want to execute the operational-mode commands in the configuration mode. It is similar to the command “do” on Cisco IOS.</em></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>NTP:</strong> Time is not only an object in physics but also a must for network appliances. One example of its significance could be the time when you want to forensic a security breach into your network. At some point of your investigation, correlating events generated by various appliances and services is inevitable. Each event has a timestamp; coherence and consistency among these time stamps across all your machines will go a long way in tracking an activity efficiently. By having an NTP server in your network, you will assure that time on all your services and appliances is precise and synchronized.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Control Plane Syslog:</strong> It is about your appliance reporting what is happening inside your control plane. Saying hello to your neighboring OSFP router is an event as well as executing every single command you type or losing one the cooling fans. We probably don’t need everything that happens behind the scene, so you need to tell your appliance what to report – it determines by facility, severity, and pattern-matching – and where to send it. For a start, I would like to log five types of events, three of them goes into separate files, one of them to a syslog server, and the last one appears directly on users’ terminal. I have decided to store my logs in a structured format, and they would be more illegible, however; they will take slightly more space to store.<br>
By committing these commands, any event that has the level of emergency immediately appears on any logged-in users’ screen.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Data Plane Syslog:</strong> This part may raise many confusions and has not been vividly explained in some books and documents.<br>
The events related to traffic, NAT, IPS, and anything that happens while the packets are passing through your SRX appliance generates in the data plane. You obliged to decide if you want to send all these events to the control plane via the internal-link <strong>(event mode)</strong> or send them directly to a log server <strong>(stream mode)</strong>.<br>
The former is merely possible if the number of your events is lower than a couple of thousands of events per second– for small SRXs and small-medium branches. As the internal-link between <strong>CP</strong> and <strong>DP</strong> is subjected to overload on the occasion that the number of <strong>E</strong>vents <strong>P</strong>er <strong>S</strong>econd <strong>(EPS)</strong> goes above a certain amount – which is around 1500, the latter is the only viable option for high-end class SRXs where thousands of events generate every second.<br>
For now, since my device is a branch device, I have decided to send all my data plane logs to control plane, then I shall decide what to do with them there. I have also decided to limit the rate of the events passing through the internal-link to 1000 EPS.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>SNMP:</strong> The propose of this ancient protocol is mainly for two purposes, management and monitoring. Various ways could be used to manage your SRX appliance, but SNMP is not one of those. Therefore, the goal of SNMP on SRX appliance is mainly for monitoring. Two types of messages we have when working with SNMP: SNMP traps(push) and SNMP pull. The pull functions are basically when your NMS server probe your device – in a regular period – to pull information about CPU usage, interfaces, policies, etc. The purpose of SNMP trap or push is when something happens, and an SRX appliance notifies the server about that particular incident. The incident could be changing an interface status from up to down, or whenever some new changes apply to the appliance. Here we will configure SNMP v2c, the community will be Juonos@123@, and the only NMS server 192.168.100.205 will be able to pull SNMP OIDs. The authorization level is read-only. SNMP traps will send any configuration change and interface up/down. You can also define SNMP name, description, and location.

<ul>
<li><strong>Local Users:</strong> The only pre-defined user on an SRX is the root user. Even if you want to have full permission access, it is not recommended to use the root user. I can think of a few reasons. One, there are things that you cannot change about root user, such as idle timeout. Two, for the most tasks, even if you are the admins of the system, you won’t need access as much as the root user, it’s better to create a user with slightly limited access that could do day-to-day tasks. Using root user for every-day use, you expose the root user credential at the risk of being compromised. Here we will define an Admin user that has almost every kind of access except a few things. For example, even Admins users shouldn’t be able to change the root password or access the shell. First, we need to create a class. Then set up the class with its permissions, authorization and other things. Finally, we create a username, define a password for it and make it a member of the Admins class. I set the password as: <strong>Younos123@</strong></li>

<li><strong>TACATACACS+/RADIUS:</strong> the Local database for storing user credentials and also for a significant number of appliances is not either efficient nor rational. If you want to add any user to manage the appliances or change anything, you will have to do it on every single one of them. Besides, you will be left with no way of logging users activities and the commands they have executed. Therefore, for the sake of consistency, efficiency, simplicity and many other reasons, a central database would need to be used.<br>
A central location to not only store all users’ credentials and authorization settings but also to record a history of their log-ins and commands they ran. The server that stores such a database could render its service using either TACACS+ or RADIUS protocols. First, we need to configure the IP address and the secret key of the server.</li>
